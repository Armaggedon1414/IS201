        <p>&ensp;I have been wrestling since I was 5 years old. I love the sport and have competed in many events and tournaments over the years.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="subtitle">History</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrestling is an ancient sport with reliefs and cave-drawings depicting wrestlers in early Egypt and France as old as 15-17,000 years ago</li>
                <li>Wrestling was added to the Ancient Olympic Games in 8th century BCE</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <li class="subtitle">Rules</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrestling is a combat sport involving grappling techniques</li>
                <li>Wrestlers score points by taking down their opponent, escaping from holds, and pinning them to the mat</li>
                <li>Matches are typically divided into 3, 2 minute periods, with the winner determined by points or pinfall</li>
                <li>Wrestlers wear singlets, headgear, and wrestling shoes</li>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <li class="subtitle">Points</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Takedown: a wrestler scores 2 points taking down an opponent and gaining control. Both the opponents knees and hands must touch the ground</li>
                    <li>Escape: a wrestler, when already taken down, may gain 1 point by managing to break contact with his opponent and return to his feet</li>
                    <li>Reversal: a wrestler, when already taken down, may gain 2 points by taking control of his opponent without first breaking contact</li>
                    <li>Near Fall: 3 point are awarded if the wrestler forces his opponent's back to break 90 degreees with the floor for 3 second; 3 points are awarded for 5 seconds</li>
                    <li>Penalty: wrestlers may gain points if their opponent uses an illegal hold, a potentially dangerous move, or stalls repeatedly despite warnings from the referee</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <li class="subtitle">Wins</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fall: a wrestler automatically wins the match by pinning both his opponent's shoulder blades to the mat for 3 seconds or as determined by the referee</li>
                    <li>Technical Fall: a wrestler automatically wins the match by scoring 15 points more than his opponent</li>
                    <li>Major Decision: a wrestler wins by Major Decision by having 8-14 points more than his opponent at the end of the match</li>
                    <li>Decision: a wrestler wins by Decision by having 1-7 points more than his opponent at the end of the match</li>
                    <li>Forfeit: a wrestler automatically wins the match if his opponent does not show up</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
